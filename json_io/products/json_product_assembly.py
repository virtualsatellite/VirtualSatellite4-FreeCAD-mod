    This information is processed to correctly place the parts in the assembly.
    The assembly itself can also have a referenced part. But his one does
    not contain information about its position and rotation. In the current assembly,
    this part is supposed to be imported in the current origin of the assembly.
    In case this assembly is a sub assembly it may have a position and rotation.

    and rotated in the super assembly. Actually this assembly is than a child product of
